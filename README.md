# stock-analysis

#Purpose of Project
The purpose of this project was to give an overview of the DAQO stocks for both 2017 and 2018 and refactor the code from the original code from the DaQO analysis to test if your code can run smoother and faster.

##Advantages/Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
The advantages of refactoring code is that you have a set outline of code available to obtain the requested results.  As a programmer you just need to rerun and see if you can improve upon the process.
Disadvantages is if there are a lot of mistakes in the original scripts, you may have a headache on your hands and may need to start from scratch.   

###Note:   I submitted what I had after several hours of YouTube, contacting Learning assistants and even a 1 hour session with a tutor where all we did was go over initializing totalVolume to equal zero.   At the end of the session, the tutor advised submit what you have and this was my best effort at completing this project   If you could please advise suggestions on how to better understand this project, I would appreciate it.
